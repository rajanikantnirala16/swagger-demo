# Swagger integration with Spring Boot

## Before learning swagger:

### Why do we need to document your RESTful API?

###  Think about the consumer.
#### •  How does the consumer know?
```
•	What is format of the request?
•	What content types your API supports?
•	What is the structure of the response?
•	Do you use HATEOAS?
•	How to test your API?
•	What kind of security mechanism you use?
```

#### Note: REST does not specify a documentation standard or a contract like SOAP (WSDL). REST gives you the flexibility to choose your documentation format and approach. But that does not mean “No documentation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

#### How do you document your RESTful API?
```There are multiple approaches to documenting your RESTful API
•	WADL (Stand for web application descriptor language)
•	RESTDocs
•	Swagger or OpenDocs
```
## What Is Swagger?
```o	Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them.
o	 While reading your API’s structure, we can automatically build beautiful and interactive API documentation. 
o	We can also automatically generate client libraries for your API in many languages and explore other possibilities like automated testing. 
o	Swagger does this by asking your API to return a YAML or JSON that contains a detailed description of your entire API. 
o	Swagger follows  OpenAPI Specification The specification asks you to include information like:
	•	What are all the operations that your API supports?
	•	What are your API’s parameters and what does it return?
	•	Does your API need some authorization?
	•	And even fun things like terms, contact information and license to use the API.
```
